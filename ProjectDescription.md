For this app, I used ReactJS for the frontend and NodeJs and Express for the backend. Google
calendar API was used in order to store all the appointments in a google calendar. MongoDB was
used to store all the info whenever a client books an appointment (id, full name, email and date of
appointment). Firebase was used to store photos of the haircuts done by the barber. This Project
made me into a better full stack developer since it helped me develop better problem-solving
skills, time management skills, code writing skills and gave me the eagerness to learn more and to
become even better as a developer. (ReactJS) (NodeJS) (MongoDB) (Express) (Firebase)
